This page is my playground for [The Grid][0], it is an attempt to build a website that automatically designs itself and it is currently in Beta. Some things are still missing - e.g. the ability to configure a fixed header or logo image - but a lot of things already work quite well:

- designing a page that automatically looks OK regardless of the content   
- sharing via a mobile app  
- support for custom domains

I've never had a real webpage on this domain anyway, so I figured it would be as good a place as any to give The Grid a try. Don't expect anything on this page except for random posts that are here just for the sake of having posts.
